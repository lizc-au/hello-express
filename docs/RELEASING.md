# Releases

We use GitHub Releases as the source of truth for versions and notes.

How to release (quick):

- Push a semver tag (e.g., v1.2.3) to main
- Open the draft release GitHub creates and polish notes if needed

Releases page: [github.com/lizc-au/hello-express/releases](https://github.com/lizc-au/hello-express/releases)

Tip: use conventional commits so autogenerated notes are useful.
